##Snake!

Snake is a game where you control an always moving character using the keys. The goal is to hit the target without hitting a wall. If you get the target, you get a point and the target appears somewhere else. The game ends when you hit the wall.

There are two different ways you can make this game. The first is to have the snake speed up every time you get a target. The second is to 

- Here is an example of the speeding up version created in Scratch: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2627038/

- Here is an example of the growing version (please turn off your sound): http://playsnake.org/

After creating the paddle game, you should know everything you need to know to create the version that speeds up, which is the easier version. So if you want to  make this game, go for it.

If you are up for a challenge, the following will take you through how to make the growing version of snake. This uses a lot of lists and functions, which were covered earlier.
